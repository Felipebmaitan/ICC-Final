This repository holds the code (jupyter notebook), presentation and report for my final Introduction to Computer Science class. 


# Summary

In this assignment, I tried to demonstrate basic natural language interpreting capabilities using Python's NLTK. I made a simple example using the Bible, filtering useless data, like stopwords and punctuation, that often don't offer much information to the dataset being analyzed, and then showing the top 20 most common "meaningful" words in the Bible. After that, I gave a quick glance at NLTK summary capability and, to finish, showed a very rudimentary NLTK chatbot.

As this code will probably ever be useful to anyone, I won't waste my time fixing any errors or translating the report to English. This repository will be for archival purposes only.
